  - Possesses consciousness, self-awareness.
  - Not yet realized.
- **Weak AI**:
  - Specialized in one task.
  - No consciousness or genuine understanding.
  - Examples: Chatbots, image recognition systems.

#### Define Intelligence & Its Categories – Natural & Artificial
- **Intelligence**: The ability to learn, understand, and apply knowledge.
